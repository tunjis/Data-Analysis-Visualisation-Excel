## Excel Data Analysis Skills Showcase

This project demonstrates proficiency in leveraging Microsoft Excel for comprehensive data analysis, manipulation, and visualization across diverse datasets, including retail sales, bike sales transactions, and student performance records.

Key Excel skills utilized include:

* **Data Manipulation & Cleaning:**
    * Structuring data effectively using **Excel Tables**.
    * Advanced **Filtering** and **Sorting** techniques to isolate and organize specific data subsets (e.g., filtering by age, sorting by performance).
    * Data cleansing using functions like **`TRIM`** and **`PROPER`** to ensure data consistency across fields (e.g., standardizing country names).

* **Formula Application & Calculation:**
    * Proficient use of core aggregation functions (**`SUM`**, **`AVERAGE`**, **`MAX`**, **`COUNTA`**) for calculating key metrics (e.g., total commissions, average scores, market counts).
    * Implementation of logical functions (**`IF`**, **`SWITCH`**, **`AND`**) for data categorization and conditional analysis (e.g., sales volume tiers, identifying top performers).
    * Application of advanced lookup and text functions (**`FILTER`** within formulas, **`TEXTJOIN`**) for dynamic data extraction and reporting.

* **Pivot Tables & Data Summarization:**
    * Creation and customization of **Pivot Tables** to summarize large datasets and perform multi-dimensional analysis (e.g., analyzing bike sales/profit by country, age group, and gender).
    * Utilizing Pivot Table features to drill down into data and identify key trends and insights across different segments.

* **Conditional Formatting:**
    * Applying **Conditional Formatting** rules to visually highlight significant data points, outliers, and trends within datasets and Pivot Tables (e.g., highest/lowest scores, most profitable markets).

* **Data Visualization:**
    * Generating various **Charts** (Line, Stacked Column, Pie) to visually represent data trends and comparisons (e.g., revenue vs. profit over time, product revenue breakdown by country, revenue share by age group).
    * Formatting charts effectively with titles, axis labels, legends, currency formatting, and data labels for clarity and impact.



## Introduction

Welcome to my GitHub repository showcasing my data analysis skills, with a particular focus on leveraging Microsoft Excel for data manipulation, analysis, and visualisation. The projects included here demonstrate proficiency in transforming raw data into actionable insights using various Excel features.

## Project 1: Retail Sales & Function Application

Used retail sales data to explore patterns and demonstrate specific Excel functions.

**Data:**
* [retail_sales_dataset.xlsx](https://justit831-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/justincracium_bootcamp_justit_co_uk/EW2mJFN6GN5HsUmKJ7xwof8BzJZ2j_6W3MkodqCRU0OeTg?e=gv4sLz): Transaction records with customer/product details and calculated commissions.

**Analysis & Skills:**

1.  **Data Handling & Calculations:**
    * Applied Filters and Sorting (e.g., Age).
    * Used `SUM` and `AVERAGE` for commission totals.
    * Implemented `SWITCH` function for categorising sales volume (High/Medium/Low).
    * *Skills: Filtering, Sorting, `SUM`, `AVERAGE`, `SWITCH` function, Conditional Logic.*

2.  **Lookup Functions (`Transactions.csv`):**
    * Demonstrated `VLOOKUP` and `XLOOKUP` for retrieving data (e.g., Product Category based on ID).
    * Used `CONCATENATE` for combining text fields
    * *Skills: `VLOOKUP`, `XLOOKUP`, `CONCATENATE`, Data Retrieval.*

3.  **Sales Summary (`PivotTable.csv`):**
    * Aggregated Total Sales by Product Category, Customer Generation, and Gender.
    * *Skills: PivotTables, Sales Analysis.*

4.  **Basic Calculations (`Task 2.csv`):**
    * Used `AVERAGE` and `MAX` for student score analysis
    * *Skills: `AVERAGE`, `MAX`.*

## Project 2: Bike Sales Analysis & Visualisation

Analysed bike sales data to understand performance and profitability.

**Data:**
* [Bike_Sales.xlsx](https://justit831-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/justincracium_bootcamp_justit_co_uk/Ea9shnOX2U9PjWQRBPGOXAEBVYqYAD8unbfY-DwmdoUdig): Raw transaction data.

**Analysis & Skills:**

1.  **PivotTable Summaries:**
    * `PivotTableProfit.csv`: Profit broken down by Age Group, Gender, and Country.
    * `PivotTableSales.csv`: Sales Volume (Order Quantity) by the same dimensions
    * *Skills: PivotTables, Data Aggregation, Multi-dimensional Analysis.*

2.  **Visualisations (from `Bike_Sales_Visualisation_Lab.pdf` & workbook):**
    * **Line Chart:** Tracked Profit and Revenue trends over multiple years (e.g., 2017-2021).
    * **Column Chart:** Compared Product Revenue across different Countries (Australia, Canada, France, etc.).
    * **Pie Chart:** Showed Revenue contribution by Customer Age Group
    * *Skills: Chart Creation (Line, Column, Pie), Data Visualisation, Trend Analysis, Comparative Analysis, Chart Formatting.*
