## Introduction

Welcome to my GitHub repository showcasing my data analysis skills, with a particular focus on leveraging Microsoft Excel for data manipulation, analysis, and visualisation. The projects included here demonstrate proficiency in transforming raw data into actionable insights using various Excel features.

## Projects Overview

### 1. Bike Sales Analysis

This project involves analysing bike sales data to understand profit and sales trends.

* **Dataset:** `Day_3_Task_1_Bike_Sales_Pivot_Lab - Justin Craciun.xlsx` (Sheets: `Bike Sales`, `Bike Sales (2)`)
    * Contains transactional data related to bike sales, including product details, costs, revenue, and customer demographics.
* **Analysis Performed:**
    * **Profit Analysis:** A PivotTable (`PivotTableProfit.csv`) was created to summarise profit margins across different categories (e.g., Product Category, Country, Age Bracket).
    * **Sales Analysis:** A separate PivotTable (`PivotTableSales.csv`) was generated to analyse total sales figures, likely sliced by similar dimensions as the profit analysis.
* **Skills Demonstrated:**
    * Data Aggregation using PivotTables.
    * Multi-dimensional analysis (slicing data by various categories).
    * Summarising key financial metrics (Profit, Sales Revenue).

### 2. Retail Sales Dataset Analysis

This project demonstrates data cleaning, manipulation, and formula-based analysis within a retail context.

* **Dataset:** `retail_sales_dataset_Master - Justin Craciun.xlsx` (Sheets: `retail_sales_dataset`, `Transactions`)
    * Contains retail transaction data, including product information, customer details (Age, Gender), pricing, and quantities.
* **Analysis Performed (as detailed in `Data_Technician_Workbook_Week1 - GitHub.docx` and workbook sheets):**
    * **Data Structuring:** Converted raw data range (`retail_sales_dataset` sheet, Columns A-H) into an Excel Table for improved manageability and analysis.
    * **Filtering & Sorting:** Applied filters and sorting logic, for instance, ordering data by 'Age' (`retail_sales_dataset` sheet). Also demonstrated advanced filtering/sorting to identify top performers based on criteria (`Task 2.csv`).
    * **Basic Calculations:** Used `SUM` and `AVERAGE` functions to calculate total and average commissions (`retail_sales_dataset` sheet, cells P10 & P11).
    * **Conditional Logic:** Implemented the `SWITCH` function (or `IFS`/nested `IF` logic) to categorise products based on sales volume (e.g., "High", "Medium", "Low" - described in `.docx` for `Task 2.csv` or similar sheet). Referenced troubleshooting and correction of the `SWITCH` formula for accuracy.
    * **Advanced Formulas:** Utilised functions like `MAX`, `TEXTJOIN`, and `FILTER` to dynamically identify and report top performers within categories (`Task 2.csv`).
    * **PivotTable Analysis:** Created a PivotTable (`PivotTable.csv`) to summarise key aspects of the retail data (e.g., sales by product, region, or customer segment).
* **Skills Demonstrated:**
    * Excel Tables for data management.
    * Data Filtering and Sorting (Basic and Advanced).
    * Core Excel Functions (`SUM`, `AVERAGE`).
    * Conditional Functions (`SWITCH`/`IF` logic).
    * Advanced Dynamic Array Functions (`FILTER`) and Text Functions (`TEXTJOIN`).
    * PivotTables for data summarisation.

### 3. Bike Sales Data Visualisation

This section highlights the ability to create compelling visualisations in Excel to communicate insights effectively, based on the principles outlined in the `Day_3_Task_3_Bike_Sales_Visualisation_Lab.pdf`. While the specific data source file for the visuals (`Bike Sales_Visualisations_Lab.xlsx`) isn't provided here, the techniques demonstrated are applicable to the Bike Sales data analysed in Project 1.

* **Visualisations Created (Conceptual):**
    * **Line Chart:** To display trends over time (e.g., Profit and Revenue by Year).
    * **Column Chart:** To compare categorical data (e.g., Product Revenue by Country).
    * **Pie Chart:** To show proportions of a whole (e.g., Revenue Contribution by Age Group).
* **Skills Demonstrated (based on PDF instructions):**
    * Selecting appropriate chart types for different data stories.
    * Creating Line, Column, and Pie charts.
    * Chart Formatting: Adding titles, axis labels, legends, data labels, and percentages for clarity and impact.
