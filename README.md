## ðŸ“ˆ Data Analysis & Visualisation Portfolio: Excel Showcase

**(Intro - Optional)**

"Welcome! This portfolio highlights my data analysis capabilities using Microsoft Excel across four main projects, each centred around a distinct workbook: `retail_sales_dataset.xlsx`, `Students.xlsx`, `Tech shop.xlsx`, and `Bike_Sales.xlsx`. I'll walk you through key tasks and skills demonstrated in each."

### Project 1: Retail Sales Analysis & Function Application

**(Workbook: `retail_sales_dataset.xlsx` and related task data)**

**Objective:** Analysed retail sales data to uncover patterns and demonstrate core Excel data handling, formula application, and summarisation skills.

**Key Activities & Skills Demonstrated:**

* **Data Structuring & Initial Cleaning:** Organised raw data into **Excel Tables**[cite: 1]; Applied **Filters** and **Sorting** (e.g., sorting customers by Age)[cite: 2].
* **Core Calculations & Logic:** Calculated metrics using **`SUM`** and **`AVERAGE`** (e.g., commissions)[cite: 3, 4]; Used **`SWITCH`** with **`AND`** logic for categorisation (e.g., sales volume tiers)[cite: 16, 18, 20].
* **Data Retrieval & Joining (Deeper Dive):** *(User mentioned - include if applicable)* Leveraged **`VLOOKUP`** / **`XLOOKUP`** to integrate data; Used **`CONCATENATE`** (or `&`) for combining text fields.
* **Summarisation with Pivot Tables:** Created **Pivot Tables** to aggregate sales data across dimensions (Product Category, Customer Generation, Gender).

### Project 2: Student Performance Analysis

**(Workbook: `Students.xlsx`)**

**Objective:** Analysed student scores to identify top performers and demonstrate targeted formula application and conditional formatting.

**Key Activities & Skills Demonstrated:**

* **Performance Calculation:** Used **`AVERAGE`** to calculate overall student scores[cite: 6].
* **Identifying Top Scores:** Applied the **`MAX`** function to find the highest scores overall[cite: 6].
* **Advanced Filtering/Formula:** Used **Filters & Sorting** and potentially advanced formulas (like **`FILTER`**, **`TEXTJOIN`** as shown in workbook examples) to identify top students per subject[cite: 5].
* **Visual Highlighting:** Employed **Conditional Formatting** to visually distinguish highest and lowest average scores[cite: 6].

### Project 3: Tech Shop Data Analysis

**(Workbook: `Tech shop.xlsx`)**

**Objective:** (Placeholder - To be defined based on analysis performed). This workbook contains gadget shop data.

**Key Activities & Skills Demonstrated:**

* *(Specific tasks and skills applied to `Tech shop.xlsx` are not detailed in the provided task documentation. This section acknowledges the file as part of the portfolio.)*

### Project 4: Bike Sales Performance & Visualisation

**(Workbook: `Bike_Sales.xlsx` / `Bike_Sales_Visualisations_Lab.xlsx`)**

**Objective:** Analysed detailed bike sales data to understand profitability drivers and market performance, then visualised key findings effectively.

**Key Activities & Skills Demonstrated:**

* **Advanced Pivot Table Analysis:** Built **Pivot Tables** for multi-dimensional analysis (Profit/Sales by Age Group, Gender, Country)[cite: 8]; Cleaned data within analysis (**`TRIM`**, **`PROPER`**)[cite: 8]; Used functions (**`COUNTA`**, **`IF`**, **`MAX`**) with Pivot results for deeper insights[cite: 8]; Applied **Conditional Formatting** to highlight key Pivot results[cite: 8].
* **Data Visualisation for Impact:** Created and formatted **Line Charts** (Revenue vs. Profit trends)[cite: 26, 30, 33-53], **Stacked Column Charts** (Product Revenue by Country)[cite: 26, 54-62], and **Pie Charts** (Revenue by Age Group)[cite: 26, 63-70]; Applied best-practice **Chart Formatting** (titles, labels, legends, number formats)[cite: 36-52, 58-62, 66-70].

### Summary of Key Excel Skills Demonstrated:

*(Note: The following skills were demonstrated across the projects detailed above, primarily based on the documented tasks for the `retail_sales_dataset.xlsx`, `Students.xlsx`, and `Bike_Sales.xlsx` workbooks.)*

* **Data Prep & Handling:** Tables, Filtering, Sorting, Cleaning Functions (`TRIM`, `PROPER`).
* **Formulas & Logic:** `SUM`, `AVERAGE`, `MAX`, `IF`, `SWITCH`, `AND`, `COUNTA`, (and potentially `VLOOKUP`/`XLOOKUP`, `CONCATENATE`, `FILTER`, `TEXTJOIN`).
* **Analysis Engine:** Pivot Tables for multi-dimensional summaries and insights.
* **Visualisation:** Creating and refining Line, Column, and Pie charts for clear communication.
* **Presentation:** Conditional Formatting, logical workbook structure.

**(Outro - Optional)**

"Across these four projects, focusing on the documented tasks within workbooks like `retail_sales_dataset.xlsx`, `Students.xlsx`, and `Bike_Sales.xlsx`, I've demonstrated a solid capability in handling data end-to-end within Excel â€“ from cleaning and manipulation through to analysis, insight generation, and impactful visualisation."










## Introduction

Welcome to my GitHub repository showcasing my data analysis skills, with a particular focus on leveraging Microsoft Excel for data manipulation, analysis, and visualisation. The projects included here demonstrate proficiency in transforming raw data into actionable insights using various Excel features.
